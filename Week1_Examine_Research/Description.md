# Constructive Research

Constructive research is perhaps the most common type of research in computer science and related fields. It involves creating and testing artifacts to solve research problems. Data science may also involve creating a new algorithm or piece of data analysis software. The fields of engineering and even information systems management can all benefit from applied constructive research. It is the research problem and the goal of the research that will dictate the type of research methodology that will be chosen.

Thomas Edison was performing constructive research when he was trying to invent the light bulb. His goal was simple: to invent a device that was capable of producing light for a prolonged time when exposed to an electric current. That was his sole criterion for measuring success. He tried many different designs until finally, he arrived at one that worked.

Later on, someone came up with a "better" idea: use several low-energy light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to produce light instead of a filament in a vacuum tube. When compared with Edison's light, the LED light uses less power, lasts longer, and is more efficient (i.e., it turns more energy into light and less energy into heat). It improves upon Edison's light in at least three measurable criteria.

That's constructive research. It's the building of things or artifacts to solve real problems and measure how well those artifacts perform when compared with what existed previously. In this course, you will examine several types of artifacts and propose extensions to them that might solve new problems. In the end, you will propose your own artifact to solve your proposed problem that you plan to address in your dissertation research.

## Signature Assignment Preview

The culminating signature assignment due towards the end of the course may require you to complete some work ahead of the due date. To ensure you are prepared and have adequate time to complete this assignment, please review the instructions by looking ahead to the signature assignment. Contact your professor if you have questions.

## Weekly Resources

Use the Course Resources link, located in the top navigation bar, to access the resources you will need to prepare for the weekly assignments. The resources may include textbook reading assignments, journal articles, websites, links to tools or software, videos, handouts, etc.

It is important to understand that the resources are meant to help you learn more about a new topic. They do not always provide you with the guidance or answers needed to complete the assignments. To be successful, you may need to do a little more research on your one using the NCU Library, general Internet sources, or support from your Professor.
