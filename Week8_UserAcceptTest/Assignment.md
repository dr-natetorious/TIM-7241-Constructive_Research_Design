# Signature Assignment: Develop a User Acceptance Testing Protocol

For the final assignment, you must develop a UAT protocol for an artifact of your choice, such as a new algorithm, programming language, game, or a new IT process. Your protocol

Your protocol should address the following:

- What is the new item or extension you are proposing?
  - The extension may be in terms of a new detection technique, a different area of application, or further areas covered by the tool.
  - You may also propose an entirely new tool or module that analyzes;
    - for example, is some security aspect of software not covered by extant tools?
    - You do not actually have to design the extension, but merely propose what it would do.
- What research problem are you solving?
  - Why is it necessary to solve this problem?
  - What value are you providing?
  - Why should other researchers and practitioners care about this proposal?
  - Provide evidence from the literature regarding the existence of this problem.
- Why does the proposed item not yet exist?
  - Why has it not been previously attempted or accomplished?
  - What are the most significant challenges that must be overcome in the creation of this solution?
- How will you verify that this item is an improvement over alternative or existing implementations?
- What are you adding to the body of knowledge?
- What artifacts will you use to ensure that your artifact was created accurately and that it provides measurable value over existing tools?
- A detailed user acceptance testing (UAT) plan,
  - including the design of appropriate tests,
  - their implementation,
  - and the evaluation process of the whole system.
  - This section should be substantially lengthy and as detailed as possible.
