# TIM-7241-Constructive_Research_Design

Papers, projects, and essays regarding constructive research.

## Description

This course is important because it addresses the "applied" aspect of information systems and computer science due to the use of theories and practices from parallel disciplines, such as economics, business, finance, and physics, to address identified issues. The "applied" designation is attributed to the utilization of cross-disciplinary field knowledge to create some process, system, program, standard, algorithm, approach, logic, metric, or theory that can be implemented, or applied to address issues with sometimes far-reaching societal, financial, and natural consequences. Thus, a design science researcher directs their effort toward the clear identification of a problem and the formulation of a viable solution that is novel and that addresses some characteristics, components, or aspects of it to reduce any negative effects.

During this course, you will be exposed to the principle and characteristics of constructive research (design science research) in the information technology and computer science domain. You will learn how to express research questions in constructive research form and identify typical types of artifacts as they are used to enhance understanding and provide solutions.

Some of the concepts and topics covered in this course include:

- Constructive Research
- Research Ethics and Quality
- Constructive Research Questions
- Constructive Research Design
- Algorithm Design
- Programming Language Design
- Software and Security Testing Tools
- User Acceptance Testing

By completing the work in this course (particularly the Week 8 Assignment â€“ Annotated Bibliography), you will have a thorough understanding of the foundations of constructive research and how it has been applied to real-life situations.

## How can I be successful

Here are a few tips to help you complete the course successfully:

- **One-to-one Learning Model** - As you know, NCU uses a unique one-to-one learning model. If you would like to connect with other students in this same course, your degree program, or others with similar interests, please explore NCU's internal social network, the Commons. You may already be connected; if not, take some time to check it out. Remember that your instructor is here to support your success, as is an entire team on the other side of your screen. Let us know how we can help

- **Weekly Resources** - The weekly resources in each course are meant to help you learn more about a new topic. They are not meant to provide you with the answers or specific guidance needed to complete the weekly assignments. To be successful, you may need to do a little more research on your one using the NCU Library, general Internet sources, or support from your professor.

- **PowerPoint Recording Feature** - Many courses in the School of Technology require you to record your presentation of a slide using the record audio feature in PowerPoint.

- **Assignment Scenarios** - Many assignments in the School of Technology require you to use your prior experience or your imagination to complete an assignment. For these types of assignments, you are encouraged to use events from your past or create fictitious data to work with during the assignment. You can even combine your past experience and fictitious data to make the scenarios more interesting or to keep your past employers anonymous. In these situations, please try to be as realistic as possible to demonstrate your understanding of the assignment to your professor. If you are uncomfortable with the assignment, please contact your professor for additional guidance.

I would like to leave you with one more important thought. Constructive research is at the heart of information technology research as it allows for tangible solutions to real-life situations. In that respect, technology can contribute to the well-being of individuals and societies towards a sustainable future.

There is a lot to do, and time flies in an 8-week course. So, let's get started!
