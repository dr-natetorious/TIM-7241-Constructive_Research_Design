# Compare String Algorithms

One of the resources for this week (Gong, Wang, & Oard), contains three string distance algorithm proposals. Each of the algorithms solves the same problem (name matching). Until such an operation can be accomplished instantaneously, there will always be room to create a new and more efficient algorithm.

1. Summarize the testing procedure for evaluating the algorithms in the Gong, Wang & Oard (2009) article and answer the following questions in your response:

- What was the criterion for success?
- How was success (or failure) measured?
- How did the authors measure/test for correctness?
- How did the authors measure/test for efficiency?
- What test cases were used and how did the authors ensure adequate coverage of the input space?

2. Imagine you have a string problem that can be solved using an algorithm and then answer the following questions comparing your approach with the one used by Gong, Wang, & Oard (2009).

- Describe the problem.
- Who would care about the algorithm and why?
- What would be the criteria for success?
- How would success/failure be measured?
- How would you measure/test for correctness?
- How would you measure/test for efficiency?
- What test cases would you use?
