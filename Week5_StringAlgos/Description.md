# Algorithm Design

Algorithms are well-defined computational procedures that, in a systematic way, produce outputs from inputs in a finite sequence of steps. They precede code development, and they provide the steps (including calculations) that software needs to perform when processing data. Algorithms are an important aspect of computing research. They are used to perform a wide variety of activities, such as performing data analysis or making operations more effective or efficient. The algorithms used in computing are frequently very complicated and are not expected to be performed manually. Fortunately, there is a wide range of tools that may be used to implement algorithms in computing research.

Algorithms are a good area for constructive research because there's just so much that can be done with them!

- New algorithms can be proposed to improve upon existing ones. Testing those is easy because the research design has already been done. The researcher only needs to apply the prior test cases to the new algorithms and show an improvement.
- Existing algorithms can be applied in a new way. This one is easy, too, since the algorithms already exist. The test cases might already exist too!
- You might combine two or more algorithms to work together, as well. If both of them were good at solving their respective problems, then why not put them together to come up with something even better?
- Sometimes you might want to propose an entirely new algorithm for solving an entirely new problem. This requires creating not only the algorithm but also the test cases and data. For these, you can find inspiration in analogous research and use similar test cases and test data.
Or something new. It's up to you!

Algorithms are frequently used to assist in measuring the difference between string sequences. These are useful in a variety of fields, including bioinformatics and natural language processing. Some popular string evaluation algorithms include the Levenshtein, Hamming, Hirschberg, and Aho-Corasick algorithms.
