# Describe Domain-Specific Languages

For this assignment, you must write a report that describes two different domain-specific languages that have been published in the past 5 years. Your selections may be extensions or new applications of existing languages.

Your report should answer the following questions for each selection:

1. In what areas of research or practice is the language typically used? What problems is it solving? What is one general research question that the language can be used to help answer?
2. What are the language's weaknesses?
3. How did the developers measure the effectiveness and usefulness of the language in meeting its purpose? What artifacts (such as compilers and test data) did the creators have to generate and use when testing the language's fitness for its purpose? How did the developers collect and analyze data related to the language?
4. How could you extend the language or apply it in a new way? What problems would this solve? Who would care about your solution, and why?
5. How would you measure the success of your new extension or application of the language? What artifacts and data would be necessary to test the success of your extension or application?
