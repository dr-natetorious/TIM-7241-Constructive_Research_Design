# Software and Security Testing Tools

Software security is an arms race between attackers and defenders. New and more sophisticated tools and techniques are being constantly created by each side in an attempt to gain an advantage over their counterpart. New protection techniques can grow from innumerable areas include cryptography, defensive coding practices, and secure design. Proposing new protection practices and mechanisms, is an important skill for researchers, along with understanding how to use existing tools and techniques to discover vulnerabilities.

Software testing is a large field, which is necessary to ensure the quality of an end product. Due to the diverse nature of software, testing applications is not easy. Detecting issues early is important for any software project, as numerous studies have shown that it is much cheaper to fix errors early in the software development lifecycle.

There are many areas of an application that should be tested. Some of those areas include (from Pressman, 2015):

- `Operability` —it operates cleanly
- `Observability` —the results of each test case are readily observed
- `Controllability` —the degree to which testing can be automated and optimized
- `Decomposability` —testing can be targeted
- `Simplicity` —reduce complex architecture and logic to simplify tests
- `Stability` —few changes are requested during testing
- `Understandability` —comprehension of the design

There are many existing tools that assist with the testing of these areas. Two popular types of tools include static and dynamic analysis tools. Static analysis tools examine the software without executing its code, while dynamic analysis tools actually run the application.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
