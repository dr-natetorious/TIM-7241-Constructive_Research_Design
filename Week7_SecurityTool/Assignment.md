# Assess Software Security Tools

For this assignment, you must assess one open-source security analysis tool and one open source application of any type that is compatible with the testing package. You may find popular security analysis tools on the web, along with instructions on how to install and run each tool. Be sure to select a popular and well-known tool to ensure you are selecting something relevant.

To analyze the security analysis tool, complete the following steps:

1. Download, install, and run the security analysis tool on your selected open-source application. Take screenshots of the execution and save any outputs from the tool to include with your assignment submission.
2. Insert the screenshots into a document and describe the results and any interesting findings. What do the results indicate? Did the tool discover any vulnerabilities?
3. Elaborate on the discovered vulnerabilities, if the tool discovered any vulnerabilities, and then clearly explain any possible negative ramifications of at least three vulnerabilities discovered by the tool. Also, explain what a malicious user could do to exploit these vulnerabilities.
4. Explain how the developers of the tool demonstrate the tool's effectiveness.
5. Determine what problems the tool is solving. What is one general research question that the tool helps to answer?
6. Explain how you could incorporate this tool into the software development process. What problems would this solve? Who would care about your solution and why?
7. Determine how you will measure the success of the tool in your proposed process incorporation.
