# Evaluate Constructive Research Designs

## Instructions

For this assignment, you must evaluate the design of three constructive research studies with different artifacts selected from the following list:

- Algorithm
- Software tool
- Theory
- Programming language
- Domain-specific language
- Framework (i.e., a software tool that is not meant to be used on its own, but extended by the programmer and integrated as part of a new solution)
- Data set
- Computational model or simulation

Write a paper that answers the following questions for each study:

1. What problem did the artifact solve? Who in the academic community would care about the problem and solution?
2. What contribution did the authors make to the body of knowledge by creating this artifact?
3. When/where/why was the artifact first proposed? Where can it be commonly used?
4. What are the strong points of the artifact? What are the issues?
5. How did the authors test the artifact? How did the authors ensure adequate coverage of possible test cases? What was the criterion for success?
6. What were the data collection methods? How did the authors analyze the data they collected and arrive at their conclusions?

Length: 5-7 pages, not including title or reference page

References: Include a minimum of 3 scholarly resources

The completed assignment should address all of the assignment requirements, exhibit evidence of concept knowledge, and demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the content presented in the course. The writing should integrate scholarly resources, reflect academic expectations and current APA standards, and adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
