# Constructive Research Methods

This week, you will focus on how to perform research on several areas of computing artifacts, including algorithms, tools, languages, IT security tools, and software design. Your research will involve designing this artifact, building and testing a prototype, and determining whether your artifact is better or an improvement over others' attempts at solving the problem. Just like the trio of scientists who invented the LED light bulb, your research will involve comparing your new artifact to what existed previously. You may use "benchmarks" or measurements of performance to which you'll compare your own artifact's performance. Hopefully, your artifact performs better!

Occasionally, there will be no existing attempt at solving a particular problem. These situations are ones in which you should be cautious because there might be a very good reason why no one has solved the problem: it may be terribly difficult or even un-solvable! If you decide to take on the problem, it will be up to you to define measurements and criteria for success. In this case, you should analyze analogous research, and then examine how others have solved similar problems. You can use their methods as a basis for yours. Tackling an entirely new problem can be difficult, but exciting!

Here is one thing to remember through all of this: in constructive research, your scholarly contribution is *not* the artifact itself. That's right. `You are not giving the scholarly community an artifact. You are giving the scholarly community a possible solution to a research problem`. The difference is subtle, but important. `Thomas Edison's research contribution was not a light bulb. His research contribution was solving the problem of needing to light up a room`!

This week, you will study several constructive research methods and examine how they address different research problems.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
