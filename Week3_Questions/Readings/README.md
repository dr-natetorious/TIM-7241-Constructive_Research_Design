## Exploring the Design Space of Embodied Architectonic Interaction (2020)

Eleni Economidou. 2020. Exploring the Design Space of Embodied Architectonic Interaction. In Companion Publication of the 2020 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference (DIS' 20 Companion). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 509–514. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3393914.3395826). [DesignSpace.pdf](DesignSpace.pdf).

## Power to the People (2018)

Lindsay Simmonds. 2018. Power to the People: Designing a better prepaid solar electricity service for rural Indian villages. In Proceedings of the 9th Indian Conference on Human Computer Interaction (IndiaHCI'18). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 80–84. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3297121.3297134). [PowerMeter.pdf](PowerMeter.pdf).

Indian villagers can use pre-paid energy, however, these programs have low adoption rates.  The researchers build a series of rapid prototypes to uncover why people are not using the program.

They conclude in this thesis summary, that previous designs are overly technical and use foreign languages (e.g., English).  After the necessary design tweaks the utility of the pre-paid energy increased.

## Let's Get Divorced (2018)

~Jodi Forlizzi, John Zimmerman, Paul Hekkert, and Ilpo Koskinen. 2018. Let's Get Divorced: Constructing Knowledge Outcomes for Critical Design and Constructive Design Research.

This is a flier for a workshop, not a paper.

## Cyber Physical Systems Applications with a Case Study of Intelligent Dispatch of PV (2021)

H. Riggs et al., "Cyber Physical Systems Applications with a Case Study of Intelligent Dispatch of PV," SoutheastCon 2021, 2021, pp. 1-7, doi: 10.1109/SoutheastCon45413.2021.9401943. [CPS_with_IntelligentDispatch](CPS_with_IntelligentDispatch.pdf).

Distributed energy grids encounter intermittent failures and require mechanisms that forecast issues.  However, collecting this information is complex due to the scale and heterogeneous CPS devices available.

The authors ask if modern key-value databases can simplify the collection and promote machine learning-based predictions.

## Analyzing Stance and Topic of E-Cigarette Conversations on Twitter (2021)

C. P. Sari Kaunang, F. Amastini and R. Mahendra, "Analyzing Stance and Topic of E-Cigarette Conversations on Twitter: Case Study in Indonesia," 2021 IEEE 11th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), 2021, pp. 0304-0310, doi: 10.1109/CCWC51732.2021.9375949. [Ecigarette](Ecigarette.pdf).

Indonesia wants to understand their population's e-cig sentiment. This problem is important because 29% of the country smokes today.

They address this problem by clustering tweets into (R1) Against/Favor/Neutral/Irrelevant.  Next they (R2) use topic models to understand reasons for those positions.
