# Constructive Research Questions

Conducting research is a challenging but rewarding process. Performing quality research allows the researcher the opportunity to explore areas that have gone unanswered, solve important problems, or even confirm an existing study. Performing quality research is a good way to not only grow yourself but, most importantly, add to the body of knowledge in your field. In this section, you will first learn how to formulate a quality research question and will then understand several methods of collecting and analyzing data.

So far, in the course, you have analyzed many constructive studies and many research questions that can be answered by constructive studies. Now, create or refine your own research problem and questions that you will use for your own dissertation research.

Performing quality research is not easy for a variety of reasons. The first is that you are likely conducting work that no one else has ever performed. You are blazing a new path in the research community. This means that you will frequently encounter issues that have not yet been previously overcome, and although there are numerous resources that you can use to assist your research, there will be no definitive guide to follow since you are conducting new work.

The first step in performing good research is formulating a quality research question. This question will drive the direction of the research you will conduct and will likely be the most difficult single sentence you will ever create. A good research question will lay the foundation for possibly months or even years of analysis.

Here are a few tips for creating good research questions:

- Do not create a question that is too broad. You want to tackle a specific issue, not solve world hunger.
- Make sure that your question is researchable. Will you be able to complete it with your allotted resources?
- Is your research question measurable? Will you be able to find data to support your position?
- Is this research question answering a problem that people care about? Is it even a real problem?
- Make sure that your research question is reasonably realistic to solve. An unsolvable research question will not serve as a good foundation for conducting work.
